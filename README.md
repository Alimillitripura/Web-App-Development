# Web-App-Development
This project includes a Python script, mock product database, PDF documentation, and a presentation. The most challenging part was simulating real-world integration without using live APIs. I solved this by using a local JSON file and simple logic to match crop IDs to products. AI tools like GPT-4 helped streamline the code and documentation.
